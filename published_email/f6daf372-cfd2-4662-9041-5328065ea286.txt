Subject: Sentinel SCA weekly update

[PROFESSIONAL CONTENT]

Here is a short weekly update about Sentinel SCA features:

This week, we've made significant progress on the following key features listed in our README: 

* Signed requests provide end-to-end encryption and tamper-evidence for all policy decisions.
* Deterministic policy decisions ensure reproducible outcomes by leveraging hash values for consistency.
* Audit-chain hashing and integrity verification guarantee the authenticity of all audit records.
* Sandbox isolation ensures that malicious code is contained within a secure environment.
* Reputation tracking enables monitoring of entity behavior, allowing for data-driven decision-making.
* Rate limiting restricts excessive requests to prevent overwhelming the system.
* Telegram alerts notify administrators of critical events in real-time.

Next step: Implement additional logging mechanisms to further enhance audit-chain hashing and integrity verification.
