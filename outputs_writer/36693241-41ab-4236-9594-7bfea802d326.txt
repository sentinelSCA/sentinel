Here is a short weekly update:

Dear Team,

I am pleased to report that we have made significant progress on the Sentinel SCA project. This week, we successfully signed off on all outstanding requests, ensuring a smooth audit trail. Additionally, our Docker deployment has been completed, and testing is underway.

To further enhance collaboration and transparency, I have implemented Telegram alerts for critical updates and notifications. This will enable us to stay informed and respond promptly to any issues that may arise.

As we move forward, our next step will be to conduct a thorough review of the audit chain to ensure all components are functioning as intended.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
