Here is a short weekly update:

**Weekly Infrastructure Update - Sentinel SCA**

This week, we made significant progress on our infrastructure development for Sentinel SCA. Key accomplishments include:

* Completing the audit chain implementation, ensuring seamless data flow and integrity.
* Implementing signed requests to guarantee the authenticity of all transactions.
* Dockerizing key services to enhance scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

These efforts have substantially improved the overall performance and security of our infrastructure. Next step: **Integrate Sentinel SCA with the existing API gateway by the end of next week**.
